                Starship is designed to deliver satellites further and at a
                lower marginal cost per launch than our current Falcon vehicles.
                With a payload compartment larger than any fairing currently in
                operation or development, Starship creates possibilities for new
                missions, including space telescopes even larger than the James
                Webb.
